# AssetViewer_V2
 Work in progress for the new version of the asset viewer

**The assets are not included but should be copied over to AssetViewer_V2/modules/jb2a_patreon/LIbrary...**

Things to work on :
- HTML/CSS all wonky
- Button pressed should scroll back to the video **or** video could be sticky to the top to follow the user around when scrolling (same for search bar)
- Add a copy filepath button for each asset
- Add a copy database path button for each asset
- make sure the search ignores capitalization
- And search should be able to include more than one word
